# How to be a good developer
Speaker: Mr. Rimi Azizi from Theta Edge Sdn Bhd

Working hour usually 9 - 5, but officially 24 hours to be honest

The reason that choose software engineer because the title is nice.

If you want to survice in SE or software development environment, you must have passion because it is very stressful.

Where do I start? Which programming languages? Suppose to learn algorithm rather than learn programming directly. Learning programming through "Hello, World" is not a good solution.

When we go about programming, it goes about algorithm, instructions. When we learn programming languages like java, scala and ada, the basis of what we do doesn't run from algorithm. The programmer must have strong sense of algorithm.

Go starbuck buy coffee, list all steps

Have to think about how the instructions combined to a loop, can the instructions segmented into sub-functions?

Should have changed the way to learn. Not just blindly copy and paste.

Pyramid of knowledge
Data, information, knowledge, wisdom

copy paste to print hello world is just Data
you understand the code when the printf print out the data, that is information
you know to use printf, when you are asked to,  is knowledge
if you have enough knowledge, you know where to use it, that is wisdom

should be able to transfer data into knowledge, when don't have knowledge, don't have the wisdom to make decision, so might be hurted in the future environment.

Understand how to learn is more important, etc when cooperating with medical, build medical system

Please do not memorize the syntax, should understand the syntax, concept

You always complaint for leacturer, but it is not about the teacher, it is about the learner
It is not about what the teacher teach, it is about what you wanted to learn

It is good to go to Hackathon. Can see many developers, see how they develope things, meet more people at your age
To know where you stand, your level etc

Try to find company from europe, can be easier be cause not so much workload
